    "### Answer\n",
    "(a) Flexible methods are expected to perform better. With a large sample size and a small number of predictors, a flexible model can take advantage of the large amount of data to fit the underlying patterns in the data more accurately without overfitting. Since the number of predictors is small, the complexity of the model will not lead to high variance, and the large sample size will help reduce the variance of the flexible model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Inflexible methods are expected to perform better. When p (number of predictors) is large and n (number of observations) is small, flexible methods tend to overfit because they try to model the relationship using a large number of predictors. This high dimensionality increases the variance, making flexible models highly sensitive to small changes in the data. In such scenarios, a simpler, less flexible method will generalize better by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Flexible methods are expected to perform better. When the relationship between the predictors and the response is highly non-linear, a flexible model is better suited to capture these complex patterns. Inflexible methods assume a fixed, simple relationship and will struggle to model the underlying complexity, leading to high bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Inflexible methods are expected to perform better. If the variance of the error terms is high, it means there is a lot of noise in the data. Flexible models, which adapt closely to the training data, will tend to overfit this noise, resulting in high variance. Inflexible methods, on the other hand, will smooth out the noise and provide a more stable and reliable fit."

    "(a) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.\\\n",
    "(b) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each prod- uct we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.\\\n",
    "(c) We are interested in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro exchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the % change in the US market, the % change in the British market, and the % change in the German market."
